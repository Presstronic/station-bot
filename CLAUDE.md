# Claude Code instructions for station-bot

## Commits
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` trailers or any AI attribution in commit messages.
- Before committing any code, always run `npm run quality` locally and confirm it passes.
- Before committing, perform an objective self-review of all changed code from the perspective of a senior principal engineer: check for SOLID principles, single responsibility, clean abstractions, naming clarity, test coverage, and any code smells or over-engineering. Surface any concerns before the code is committed.

## Workflow
- All changes go through: issue → feature branch → PR. No direct commits to main.
- When starting work on a new issue, assign it to `GitAddRemote` if possible.
- Branch naming: use a prefix matching the change type — `feature/ISSUE-{n}`, `bug/ISSUE-{n}`, `chore/ISSUE-{n}`, `release/v{x.y.z}`
- PR title format: `<type>: ISSUE-{n} — description` (Conventional Commits style — e.g. `feature`, `bug`, `chore`, `fix`, `release`)
- PRs close issues via "Closes #n" in body
- All PRs are squash-merged into main
- Quality gate before every PR: `npm run quality`
- When addressing code review comments: reply to the comment explaining what was done, then resolve it.

## Security
- Never commit `.env` files, credentials, private keys, or the `certs/` directory — all are `.gitignore`d
- If a secret is accidentally committed: rotate it immediately, then scrub the history (BFG or `git filter-repo`) and force-push
- SSL/TLS certs are generated via `scripts/gen-certs.sh` — never commit the output
- Dependency security patches get their own `chore/ISSUE-{n}` branch and PR; run `npm audit` before raising one
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` is part of the `quality` gate — high and critical severity findings are hard blockers

## Database
- Migration tool: `node-pg-migrate` — migrations live in `./migrations/`
- Scaffold a new migration: `npm run migrate:create -- <name>`
- Apply migrations: `npm run migrate:up` (requires `DATABASE_URL`)
- Roll back one step: `npm run migrate:down` — use with care in production
- Never run destructive SQL (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE` without `WHERE`) without an explicit backup or user confirmation
- Every PR that changes the schema must include the corresponding migration file

## Release Process
1. Cut a `release/v{x.y.z}` branch from `main`
2. Bump the version in `package.json` — this is the canonical source of truth and what the Docker publish workflow validates against
3. Run `npm run quality` — must pass before opening the PR
4. Open a PR titled `release: v{x.y.z} — <short description>`; body should summarize what's in the release
5. Squash-merge into `main`
6. Tag the merge commit on `main`: `git tag v{x.y.z} && git push origin v{x.y.z}` — never tag the release branch itself
7. Create a GitHub Release from that tag with human-readable release notes
8. Build and push the Docker image tagged both `:v{x.y.z}` and `:latest`

## Testing
- **Unit tests** (filename: `*.test.ts`) — the bulk of the test suite; cover utilities, pure logic, policies, services, and repositories using mocks.
- **Integration tests** (filename: `*.integration.test.ts`) — supplemental only; reserved for critical system communication checks (e.g. verifying real DB queries execute correctly, external service contracts). Require a live Postgres instance (`DATABASE_URL` must be set). Do not duplicate what a unit test already covers.
- Every PR must include unit tests for changed/new logic and integration tests where a critical system boundary is introduced or modified.
- Tests live in a `__tests__/` directory co-located with the module they cover.

## Incidents / Production Bugs
- Production bugs get a `bug/ISSUE-{n}` branch — never hotfix directly to main

## Pre-PR Self-Review Checklist
Before opening a PR, verify:
- [ ] `npm run quality` passes
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, tokens, or environment-specific values
- [ ] Migration included if schema changed
- [ ] `docker-compose` config tested if infra changed
- [ ] For releases: version bumped in `package.json`
- [ ] Documentation is consistent with the final implementation: inline comments, PR title/body/test-plan, and any referenced GitHub issues all reflect what was actually built — not an earlier draft or superseded approach
